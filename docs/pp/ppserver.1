.SH SECURITY
Due to the security concerns it is highly recommended to run ppserver.py with an non-trivial secret key (-s command line argument) which should be paired with the matching secret keyword of PP Server class constructor. An alternative way to set a secret key is by assigning 
.B pp_secret 
variable in the configuration file 
.B .pythonrc.py 
which should be located in the user home directory (please make this file readable and writable only by user). 
The secret key set in .pythonrc.py could be overridden by command line argument (for ppserver.py) and secret keyword (for PP Server class constructor).
